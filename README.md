# Stan Web Demo

Inspiration: https://github.com/georgestagg/mnist-classifier-blas-wasm/

Based on a (currently in-development) version of [TinyStan](https://github.com/WardBrian/tinystan)

Easiest way to view this is to run `python3 -m http.server 8000 -d www/` and then open `http://localhost:8000/`
in your browser.
